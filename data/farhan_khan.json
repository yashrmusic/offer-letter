  "bio": "I have not previously undertaken a formal internship, but my architectural journey has been deeply shaped through extensive academic projects and freelance experience. My studio work spans diverse typologies, including a residential project (Sem 2), a post office (Sem 3), hostel design (Sem 4), a medical care and nursing home facility (Sem 5), a university campus (Sem 6), and a comprehensive group housing design (Sem 7). Alongside these, I have produced numerous working drawings and undertaken freelance design work, which has strengthened my practical understanding, technical precision, and confidence in architectural drawing and design.\nAdditionally, through these continuous studio engagements and hands-on design explorations, I have accumulated the equivalent of 3.5 years of rigorous architectural experience, gained through academic practice, working drawings, and freelance work, shaping a strong foundation in design thinking and execution.",
